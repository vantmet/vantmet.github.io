<p>I recently had a “stimulating discussion”* with Tom about MPIO initiated from a virtualized guest OS to a new SAN I am installing, and the pros and cons there of. This is one of those situations where the constraints of the technology make sense in a physical situation, but look a bit odd virtualized, so I wanted to ensure that I had the best possible solution for my needs, with the least extra effort, and importantly, some logic to back up the decision.</p>
