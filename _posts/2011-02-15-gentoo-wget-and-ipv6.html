<p>Well, I may as well make use of my IPv6 Tunnel, but how to get Gentoo to prefer IPv6 where it exists?</p>
<p>My /etc/make.conf has lines for wget, but apparently they are out of date and have invalid escaping, leading to an error:</p>
<p>    ValueError: No escaped character</p>
<p>Looking at a newer make.conf.example (hidden away in /usr/share/portage/config/make.conf.example) I see that the way file paths are written has changed. Merging the command to prefer IPv6 and the new format gives:</p>
<p>    FETCHCOMMAND="/usr/bin/wget --prefer-family=IPv6 -t 5 --passive-ftp  -O \"\${DISTDIR}/\${FILE}\" \"\${URI}\""<br />
    RESUMECOMMAND="/usr/bin/wget -c --prefer-family=IPv6 -t 5 --passive-ftp  -O \"\${DISTDIR}/\${FILE}\" \"\${URI}\""</p>
<p>Which works like a charm....</p>
