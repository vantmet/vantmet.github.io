<p>Hopefully this will be the first in a series of posts exploring the testing and implementation of IPv6 in the network I administer. My ultimate goal is to have our public facing web servers dual stack, and accessible by both IPv4 and IPv6.</p>
<p>For the moment, I have a request in to our ISP for a /56 block which should be actioned in the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Wish me luck!</p>
