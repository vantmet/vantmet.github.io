<p>This morning I had a list of Exchange 2010 move requests that were sat in a queued state. None in progress, but a few complete.Â So what was holding them up?</p>
<p>First I tried suspending/resuming them:</p>
<blockquote><p>Get-MoveRequest -multitenant | suspend-moverequest -Confirm:$false</p>
<p>Get-MoveRequest -multitenant | resume-moverequest</p></blockquote>
<p>That didn't help.</p>
<p>Next I tried removing and re-creating the requests:</p>
<blockquote><p>[PS] C:\scripts&gt;Get-MoveRequest -MultiTenant | Get-MoveRequestStatistics | select displayname,exchangeguid,targetdatabase | export-csv moves.csv</p>
<p>[PS] C:\scripts&gt;Get-MoveRequest -MultiTenant | Remove-MoveRequest -Confirm:$false</p>
<p>[PS] C:\scripts&gt;Import-Csv .\moves.csv |foreach-object {new-moverequest -confirm:$false -Identity $_.Exchangeguid -targetdatabase $_.Targetdatabase}</p></blockquote>
<p>But still no dice. The next thing I noticed though was that the moves were all targeted at databases on the same server, so I went hunting services on that machine. It turns out that the <strong>"Microsoft Exchange Replication</strong>" service was stopped. Kicked that into action, and bingo, 4 moves went to "In Progress"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
