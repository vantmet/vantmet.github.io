This is the fourth post in the NSX Packet Walks series. You probably want to start at [the first post](http://vantmet.github.io/2015/02/10/packet-walks).

Up to now we have focused on the traffic from one VM to another VM somewhere within the NSX system, as well as how traffic moves between physical hosts. But what if you're data center isn't 100% virtualised? Can you still use NSX? What are the constraints? This post will look at this question.
