title: VCP Foundation Objective 1.1: Identify vSphere Architecture and Solutions
categories: vmware nsx

This is the start of the series digging into the blueprint for the VCP Foundation Exam. This post will deal with "Objective 1.1 Identify vSphere Architecture and Solutions for a given use case". Let's get started.

### Identify available vSphere editions and features

There are essentially 11 editions of vSphere available today, although the comparison on the website only lists 10, and it is debatable if the last one I have included here should be considered part of vSphere at all. I've included it though, because it is the base on which the rest is built, and it's good to know it exists. There are a lot of acronyms in this table, most of them we will dig into later
